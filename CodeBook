Introduction

Rawdata obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Training data were collected from the following files:
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_train.txt

The test data were collected from the following files:
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_test.txt

The label data were collected from the following files:
features.txt
activity_labels.txt
========================================================================
Script -> run_analysis.R

Raw data map to original variables:

Training data extracted -> target variable:
X_train.txt -> RawTrain 
y_train.txt -> RawTrainLabel
subject_train.txt -> RawTrainSubjects

The test data extracted -> target variable:
X_test.txt -> RawTest
y_test.txt -> RawTestLabel
subject_test.txt -> RawTestSubjects

The label data extracted -> target variable:
features.txt -> RawLabels
activity_labels.txt -> act_labels

No changes are done at this stage. The variables are an exact match to the raw data.

Package dplyr is used mostly to read the data in and convert it into tables.
=====================================================================================
Data Transformation

Variables:
-'temp'
	The first transformation done is to add the label descriptions from 'RawLabels' obtained from file 
	"features.txt" to a new dataset called 'temp'. Dataset 'temp' is converted to a data frame to make 
	it easier to work with and view.
-'TrainLabels' and 'TestLabels'
	The next transformation is to merge the activity labels and the RawTrainLabel and RawTestLabel from file 		

	"activity_labels.txt" to new variables 'TrainLabels' and 'TestLabels'. The activity code and description 
	are added.
-'Train' and 'Test'
	Function tbl_df is used to convert the 'RawTrain' and 'RawTest' dataset into a tables. These tables are
	stored in varaibles call 'Train' and 'Test' respectively.
	A further transformation is done by doing a bind_cols call to join the label variables created in the 
	previous step to the newly created tables. So at this stage the 561 feature descriptions from the raw data
	is joined with the test and train results respectively.
	The next step is to add the subjects to the test and train result sets. The columns that are added are 
	renamed at this stage to avoid duplicate column names. The new column name is 'Subject'.
-'myData'
	At this point the 'Test' adn 'Train' datasets are merged to form one dataset
-'myData2'
	Select only the activity description (V2), Subject and any column containing "std()" or "mean()" are added to
	a new dataset 'myData2.
	Rename column V2 to activity description. Replaced the following with more meaningful text in the column headings:
	t -> "time"
	f -> "frequency"
	Acc ->"Accelerometer"
	Gyro -> "Gyroscope"
	Mag -> "Magnitude"
	BodyBody -> "Body"

The tidying of data is using package tidyr.
-mySummary
	This is a dataset where the data is grouped by activity description, the Subject and is based on the final dateset
	'myData2.
-myTidy
	A summary is created based on 'myData2' to summarise each variable as a mean per each group created. This data is 	

	then the final dataset called 'myTidy' and written out as text file.
